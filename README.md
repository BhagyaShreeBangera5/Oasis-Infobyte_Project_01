 🧮 Calculator Web Application

Oasis Infobyte – Web Development Internship | Task 1

📌 Project Description

The Calculator Web Application is a responsive and user-friendly web project developed as part of Task 1 of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship.
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.

The application provides a clean and intuitive interface, ensuring ease of use across different screen sizes. JavaScript is used to handle user input, perform calculations, and dynamically update the display in real time.

This project helped strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and basic JavaScript logic**, making it a solid foundation for further web development projects.

🔑 Key Highlights
* Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* Performs basic arithmetic operations accurately
* Responsive and clean UI design
* Efficient handling of user input and calculations
* Beginner-friendly and lightweight web application
